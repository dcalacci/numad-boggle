       After you are done constructing a word, you can submit the word by 
       pressing the "submit word" button, and you can clear the word
       that you are currently building using the "clear word" button.
       You receive one point if the word is three letters.  If the word is
       over three letters long, you receive a point for every additional letter.\n
       For example:\n
       cat would score one point\n
       home would score two points\n
       homes would score three points\n

       Some pieces of code were inspired by answers to questions on StackOverflow,

Sudoku is a logic-based number placement puzzle.
Starting with a partially completed 9x9 grid, the
objective is to fill the grid so that each
row, each column, and each of the 3x3 boxes
(also called <i>blocks</i>) contains the digits
1 to 9 exactly once.</string>
